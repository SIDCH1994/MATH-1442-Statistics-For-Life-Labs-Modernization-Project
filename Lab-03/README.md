# 📘 Lab 03 — Describing, Exploring, and Comparing Data  
**MATH 1442: Statistics for Life**

---

## 🔍 Lab Overview

Lab 03 deepens students’ understanding of **descriptive statistics** by focusing on how numerical data can be summarized, visualized, and compared across groups. Building on Jamovi navigation skills introduced in Labs 01 and 02, this lab emphasizes **interpreting distributions**, **choosing appropriate measures of center**, and **understanding variability and relative standing** within a dataset.

Students explore summary statistics, histograms, box plots, side-by-side comparisons, and Z-scores using a real-world dataset. The lab highlights how descriptive tools work together to reveal structure, skewness, outliers, and group differences—skills that are foundational for later statistical inference.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students can:

- Compute and interpret key **summary statistics** (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, range)
- Explain when the **mean or median** is the more appropriate measure of center
- Use **histograms** to assess distribution shape and skewness
- Construct and interpret **box plots** and the **five-number summary**
- Compare distributions across groups using **side-by-side box plots**
- Interpret **outliers** and variability within and between groups
- Calculate and interpret a **Z-score** as a measure of relative standing
- Communicate descriptive findings using appropriate statistical language

## 📊 Statistical Concepts Covered

- Measures of central tendency (mean, median)
- Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation)
- Distribution shape (symmetry, skewness)
- Histograms with density overlays
- Five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max)
- Box plots and outlier detection
- Group comparisons using categorical variables
- Standardization and Z-scores
- Contextual interpretation of numerical summaries

## 📁 Dataset

Students analyze the **Pennsylvania High School Seniors dataset**, collected as part of the *U.S. Census at School* project.

### Dataset Characteristics

- ~338 observations and ~30 variables
- Mix of **numerical** and **categorical** variables
- Domains include:
  - Physical characteristics (e.g., height, arm span)
  - Demographics
  - Behavior and lifestyle measures
  - Communication and technology usage

This dataset is well-suited for descriptive analysis, group comparisons, and discussion of variability and outliers.

## 🔄 Conceptual Workflow

Rather than focusing on software mechanics, this lab emphasizes **statistical reasoning**:

1. **Context & Variables**
   - Identify numerical vs. categorical variables
2. **Numerical Summaries**
   - Describe center and spread using summary statistics
3. **Visualization**
   - Examine distribution shape using histograms and box plots
4. **Comparison**
   - Compare distributions across groups using side-by-side box plots
5. **Relative Standing**
   - Use Z-scores to interpret individual values within a distribution
6. **Interpretation**
   - Draw conclusions grounded in context and variability
