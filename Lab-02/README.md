# 📘 Lab 02 — Exploring Data with Tables and Graphs

MATH 1442: Statistics for Life


## 🔍 Lab Overview

Lab 02 focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through tables and graphical summaries. Building on the data-handling foundations introduced in Lab 01, this lab helps students understand why graphs matter, how different visualizations encode information, and when to use specific plots based on data type and analytical goals.

Using Jamovi and selected visualization modules, students learn to transform raw data into frequency tables, histograms, and categorical plots, and to compare samples versus populations visually.

⚠️ Note: The full instructional lab manual, screenshots, and grading rubrics are University-owned instructional materials and are intentionally not included in this public repository.


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students are able to:

- Create frequency and relative frequency distributions

- Transform continuous numeric variables into categorical (binned) variables

- Construct and interpret histograms and relative histograms

- Compare distributions across groups using categorical variables

- Visually compare sample and population distributions

- Select appropriate visualization tools for different data types

- Communicate insights using clear graphical summaries


## 🧠 Key Statistical Concepts
**Tabular Summaries**

- Frequency distributions

- Relative frequency distributions

**Graphical Summaries**

- Histograms (count vs density)

- Relative histograms

- Bar plots

- Pie charts

- Dot plots

**Distributional Features**

- Shape (skewness, modality)

- Center (mean, typical values)

- Spread (range, variability)

- Representativeness of samples

**Sampling & Comparison**

- Visual comparison of population vs random sample

- Impact of sampling on distributional appearance


## 🧰 Tools & Technology

- Jamovi (GUI-based statistical software built on R)

- Jamovi Syntax Mode (auto-generated R code)

- vijPlots module for enhanced visualizations

- R (exposed through Jamovi)

- CSV dataset (Cars_CD.csv)

Jamovi enables students to:

- See R code generated by GUI actions

- Customize plots without writing complex syntax

- Maintain reproducible, transparent analysis workflows


## 📊 Dataset Overview

This lab uses a real-world automobile dataset containing information on vehicle pricing, performance, and characteristics.

Dataset highlights include:

- Vehicle attributes (price, year, mileage)

- Engine and performance metrics

- Fuel type and transmission

- Ownership and seller characteristics

- Physical dimensions and capacity measures

The dataset supports both numeric and categorical analysis, making it well-suited for teaching visualization choices and distribution comparison.

## 🔁 Lab Workflow (High-Level)

1. **Enable Reproducible Analysis**

  - Activate Jamovi’s syntax mode to view the underlying R code

2. **Random Sampling**

  - Generate a random sample using Jamovi’s filtering tools

  - Toggle between sample and population views

3. **Frequency Distributions**

  - Transform continuous variables into categorical bins

  - Create frequency and relative frequency tables

4. **Graphical Exploration**

  - Plot histograms and relative histograms

  - Compare distributions across categorical groups

5. **Distribution Comparison**

  - Visually compare the sample vs. the population

  - Assess similarity in shape, center, and spread

6. **Alternative Visualizations**

  - Construct bar plots, pie charts, and dot plots

  - Evaluate strengths and limitations of each plot type


## 🧪 Visualization Techniques Emphasized

- Histograms

  - Count vs density interpretation

- Grouped vs Faceted Histograms

  - Comparing distributions across categories

- Bar Charts

  - Frequency comparison for categorical variables

- Pie Charts

  - Proportion-based representation

- Visual Decision-Making

  - Choosing the “right” plot for a given question

Students are prompted to justify visualization choices based on data type, audience, and analytical intent.
