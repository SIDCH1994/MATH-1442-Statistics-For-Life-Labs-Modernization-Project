# 📘 Lab 01 — Introduction to Statistics & Jamovi

MATH 1442: Statistics for Life


## 🔍 Lab Overview

This lab introduces students to statistical thinking, data structure, and sampling concepts using Jamovi, a graphical interface built on top of the R statistical engine. The lab is designed as students’ first exposure to applied data analysis in the course, emphasizing interpretation, reproducibility, and real-world context rather than computation-heavy workflows.

Jamovi is used as a bridge between point-and-click analysis and R programming, allowing students to explore data visually while gradually interacting with R code through Jamovi’s built-in R editor.

⚠️ Note: The full lab manual, instructional screenshots, and grading rubrics are University-owned instructional materials and are intentionally not included in this public repository.


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students are able to:

- Navigate the Jamovi interface and manage data files

- Identify and correctly classify variables by type and level of measurement

- Apply and compare common sampling techniques

- Interpret sampling results and reflect on representativeness and bias

- Understand how R code operates within a GUI-based statistical workflow


## 🧠 Key Statistical Concepts

This lab focuses on foundational ideas introduced early in introductory statistics:

- Types of Variables

  - Quantitative (Discrete vs Continuous)

  - Qualitative (Categorical)

- Levels of Measurement

  - Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

- Sampling Methods

  - Simple Random Sampling

  - Stratified Sampling

  - Systematic Sampling

  - Cluster Sampling

- Reproducibility

  - Use of random seeds in R

  - Transparent, repeatable workflows


## 🧰 Tools & Technology

  - Jamovi (GUI-based statistical software built on R)

  - R (via Jamovi R Editor)

  - Python (Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook) for data cleaning

  - CSV-based real-world dataset (NHANES)


Jamovi allows students to:

  - Store data and results together in a single .omv file

  - Export autogenerated R code

  - Combine narrative text, output, and code in a single analysis document


## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this lab is derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and contains:

- 3000 observations

- 20 variables spanning:

  - Demographics (age, gender, race, education)

  - Health indicators (BMI, cholesterol, diabetes status)

  - Lifestyle variables (sleep, smoking, work status)

A cleaned version of the dataset, along with data extraction and cleaning scripts, is available in this repository under:
```

```

## 🔁 Lab Workflow (High-Level)

Students complete the lab through the following stages:

1. Data Import & Inspection

    - Load CSV data into Jamovi

    - Verify variable types and measurement levels

2. Variable Classification

   - Inspect and modify data types where needed

   - Justify classification decisions

3. Sampling via R Code

   - Run R scripts inside Jamovi to generate samples

   - Modify seeds and sample sizes

4. Comparison & Interpretation

   - Compare sampling methods

   - Reflect on representativeness and bias

5. Communication of Results

   - Annotate outputs using Jamovi’s markdown-style results panel

   - Export analysis outputs as a PDF


## 🧪 Sampling Methods Implemented

Sampling is introduced using simple, readable R code embedded inside Jamovi:

- Simple Random Sampling – unbiased baseline

- Stratified Sampling – ensures subgroup representation

- Systematic Sampling – interval-based selection

- Cluster Sampling – group-based selection

Each method is paired with interpretation prompts to help students evaluate:

- Which method is more representative

- How sample design affects conclusions

- When each method is appropriate in real-world studies


## 🧩 GAISE Alignment (College Report)

This lab aligns with the GAISE 2016 recommendations by:

- Emphasizing statistical thinking over computation

- Using real, contextualized data

- Encouraging active learning and reflection

- Integrating technology for conceptual understanding

- Supporting reproducible analysis
